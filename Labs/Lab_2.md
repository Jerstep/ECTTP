Lab 2: 
 
Grading Matrix 

Trait | Very Good | Good | Acceptable | Unsatisfactory	
--- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Specifications* | The program produces correct results and meets all specifications. | The program works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications. | The program produces correct results but does not display them correctly. | The program is producing incorrect results.
*Readability* | The code is exceptionally well organized and very easy to follow. | The code is fairly easy to read. | The code is readable only by someone who knows what it is supposed to be doing.| The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read.|

## Basic   

Use the setup() function and the draw() function to draw an orange ellipse to the screen.   
Use variables for the x, y, ellipseWidth and ellipseHeight.      

## Advanced  

Use a variable for the x-position of the ellipse and inside the draw function add 1 to the variable you just created every frame, so that the ellipse starts moving to the right.  
Use a variable for the width and height of the ellipse and inside the draw function add 1 to the variable you just created every frame, so that the ellipse grows in size.  

## Expert    

Make a blue square which moves from the right bottom corner to the left top of the screen.     
Try to make it go back and forth so that it never leaves the screen.     
Make it grow and shrink in size while it moves so that it is at its biggest in the left top corner and smallest in the right bottom corner.    
(bonus: Try to make sure the edges of the square do not overshoot the edges of the screen)    
(hint: check the reference for the if-statement or take a look at the lerp-function)
