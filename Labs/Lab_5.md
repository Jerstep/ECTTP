Trait | Very Good | Good | Acceptable | Unsatisfactory	
--- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Specifications* | The program produces correct results and meets all specifications. | The program works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications. | The program produces correct results but does not display them correctly. | The program is producing incorrect results.
*Readability* | The code is exceptionally well organized and very easy to follow. | The code is fairly easy to read. | The code is readable only by someone who knows what it is supposed to be doing.| The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read.|
*Delivery* |The program was delivered on time. | |  |  The Code was not delivered on time


## Basic  

Write a function which prints the numbers 1 to 100.  
But for multiples of three print `high` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `five`.  
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `highfive`.

## Advanced  	 

Create a chessboard with black and white rectangles of size 100x100 on your screen.  
A chessboard has 8x8 squares alternating between black and white.
Make use of a for-loop or while-loop.

Hint: You can use the modulo operator to check if a square is odd or even

## Expert  

Create a chessboard with black and white rectangles but divide the four squares in the center into four rectangles each (50x50 pixels) and color them red.
