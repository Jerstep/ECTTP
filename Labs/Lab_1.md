## Lab 1: 
 
##### Due Date 

Turn each lab in at the end of the workgroup by zipping your code and submitting it to the website(visit http://www.elvishasleftthebuilding.nl/geni, to find the submitpage).

##### Grading Matrix 

Trait | Very Good | Good | Acceptable | Unsatisfactory	
--- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Specifications* | The program produces correct results and meets all specifications. | The program works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications. | The program produces correct results but does not display them correctly. | The program is producing incorrect results.
*Readability* | The code is exceptionally well organized and very easy to follow. | The code is fairly easy to read. | The code is readable only by someone who knows what it is supposed to be doing.| The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read.|


##Basic

Download Processing 3.4:
https://processing.org/download/?processing

Create a new sketch and save it under the name: ECTTP_homework_achternaam_voornaam_labnr

At the right top you will find a dropdown button which says Java, click on it and select Add Mode... type in Python and install the python module (this may require a restart of processing).
You are now ready to program your first code!

Create a program which prints "Hello World", use the print function to print 

##Advanced

Go to http://py.processing.org/reference/ and look for the function called size()
Adjust the screen size by using the size function 
Then look for the rect() function
Use it to draw a rectangle on your screen

Try storing the numbers you use by making a variable for each number, if you don't know how to create a variable, check the slides or ask the student assistents!

##Expert

Create a variable called xPos which stores the x-position of a rectangle, add one to this variable every frame.  
Draw a rectangle on screen using the xPos variable. You will notice a moving square across the screen.  
To clear the background, you can use the background(r,g,b) function which draws a background with a colour.  
Experiment with the order to see the different effects.


When you are done, zip your entire folder and send it to your lab teacher (see top of the page, DO NOT EMAIL YOUR ASSIGNMENT)

####Are you lost? 
SPEAK UP! We will help you I promise. Don't let this drag on and you are not alone! :) 
Programming is crazy hard the first time you learn about it.
 
Why not give this site a try. It's super awesome and very clear. http://www.learnpython.org 

####Are you bored? 
Are you horridly bored? Check out some of the examples in Processing under File > Examples... 
Pick a category (I recommend Topics/Simulate/Flocking) and try changing some of the values to see what happens
